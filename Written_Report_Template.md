# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This analysis was completed to determine how different campaigns (theater, technology, music, film & video etc.) fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges
The first deep dive into the data (Excel tab: Theater Outcomes by Launch Date) is available to show outcomes (successful, failed, and canceled) based on launch date month.  

The data can be explored by Parent Category (theater, technology, music, film & video etc.) and Year of  launch date.

Two concerns to note are around comparing different countries and the different countries having different currencies.  If more time is allotted a deeper dive within countries to normalize the data might be warranted.  


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The graph below shows outcomes based on launch date month for the Theater campaign.  


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Next deep dive was around the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount ranges.

The graph below shows the relationship between goal amount ranges (x-axis) and the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays (y-axis).



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The trend indicates the months of May and June have greater success rates. The overall trend of successful campaigns tapers off by the end of the year.  The failed rate doesn't have much variation across months and therefore can be analyzed with other data points to better understand the drivers.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Play Campaigns with goals greater than $45,000 had little to no success.  Play Campaigns with goals less than $1,000 were the most successful, based on the percentage successful calculation.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
There is a limited sample size (n=1,047) of plays data.  Of the data available for plays the majority of records are for small goals less than $4,999. It also might be worth while to explore the data by currency as not all currencies are created equal.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
A pivot chart could be created to look at the data based on country and or currency.  This would allow users to filter to individual countries or currencies.  Along with comparing countries or currencies you could explore specific parent categories or subcategories to provide additional insights.  Another option with the data could be to create an interactive Pivot using Slicers.  Slicers make it easy to understand what is being displayed and provide buttons that can be used to filter.
