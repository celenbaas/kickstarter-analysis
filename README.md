# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performed data analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.

The below graph shows which parent categories performed well and which ones did not.

Narrowing the focus to theatrical productions its clear that plays are successful.

When looking at the trends the data tells us the months of May and June have greater success rates and the overall trend tapers off by the end of the year.

Recommendations:
Based on the analysis of the Kickstarter Campaigns I would suggest creating a play in the US.  I would recommend to launch the campaign in May.
